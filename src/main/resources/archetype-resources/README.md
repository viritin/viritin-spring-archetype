# Getting started with Vaadin and Spring Boot

This is a minimalistic base project for Vaadin 8 and Spring Boot. This is pretty much the same as you get from
start.spring.io, but with a UI class with an integration to a dummy Spring service.

To try out your app, execute:

    mvn spring-boot:run

If you are new to Vaadin, go through [the tutorial](https://vaadin.com/tutorial/).
